# React + Vite

This project should resamble an Instagram clone. I am doing this following a tutorial.
For the project I will be using React + VIte and Chakra UI.
This is the first time I'm using Chakra UI and so far it has been very helpfull and seems easy-to-use.

Setup goes like this:
1. I listen to the instructor to see what components are needed
2. First I will try to create components on my own.
3. I see the solution by the istructor.

Then I will correct what needs to be corrected.
So far the project seems simple eoungh for me to understand and majority of work so far focuses on styling the components.

For now I have made a design for authentication page, sidebar and part of the home page.

On second commit home page is finished and I started working on the design for profile page.

New commit. Profile posts are finished and I started working on the modal. Basically all the elements used before are now used again with a drifferent position and setup.
Lots of css properties are used as well so the page looks nice on all screen sizes.
